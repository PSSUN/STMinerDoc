# Introduction

Spatial transcriptomics revolutionizes transcriptomics by incorporating positional information. However, an emergency problem is to find out the gene expression pattern which can reveal the special region in tissue and the find out the genes only expression in those regions. 

 Here we propose “SPFinder” based on the Gaussian mixture model to solve this problem. SPFinder is a general non-noise sensitive method, it was test on various dataset from different technology and work well.

SPFinder is implemented as an open-source Python package and is available for use at [SPFinder](https://github.com/PSSUN/SPFinder).
